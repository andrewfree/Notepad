If you haven't heard of him yet, Geotheory will soon be on your radar for any of his subsequent releases. Armed with a unique style and dripping in talent, Geotheory crafts a wonderous mixture of future beats in his new EP titled '10k'. As a member of Flow-Fi, a collective of forward thinking and talented artists, I believe that Geotheory will be one of the greatest emerging artists to watch in the years to come. Despite releasing this EP in order to celebrate 10k followers on Soundcloud, Geotheory has managed to wrack up an additional 1000+ followers, showing that he is soon to have a meteoric rise to wide spread recognition in the dance music community. I, for one, couldn't be happier if that means I'll get to see him live somewhere.
